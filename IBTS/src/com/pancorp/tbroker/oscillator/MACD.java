/**
 * (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
 * 
 * The MACD is an oscillating indicator, fluctuating above and below zero. It is both a trend following 
 * and momentum indicator.
 * One basic MACD strategy is to look at which side of zero the MACD lines are on. 
 * Above zero for a sustained period of time and the trend is likely up; 
 * below zero for a sustained period of time and the trend is likely down. 
 * Potential buy signals occur when the MACD moves above zero, and 
 * potential sell signals when it crosses below zero.
 * 
 * Signal line crossovers provide additional buy and sell signals. 
 * A MACD has two lines--a fast line and a slow line. 
 * A buy signal occurs when the fast line crosses through and above the slow line. 
 * A sell signal occurs when the fast line crosses through and below the slow line.
